        "- Live code\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Kernels**: Separate processes started by the notebook web application that runs users' code in a given language and returns output back to the notebook web application. The kernel also handles things like computations for interactive widgets, tab completion and introspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Notebook documents**: Self-contained documents that contain a representation of all content visible in the notebook web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, narrative text, equations, images, and rich media representations of objects. Each notebook document has its own kernel."

More specifically, Google Colababoratory or \"Colab\" allows you to write and execute code in the browser, see results of computation in different media representations and author narrative text using \"Markdown\" language. The advantage of Colab over the default Jupyter Notebook Web Application is the ability to benefit from all the Jupyter Notebook's features with zero configuration required.\n",

For each notebook document that a user opens, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. The deafault kernel runs Python code. Check [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1-Introduction-to-Python-Programming.ipynb) for an introduction in Python programming.\n",
